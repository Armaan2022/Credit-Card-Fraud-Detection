# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Overview
Credit card fraud occurs when an unauthorized person gains access to your information and uses it to make purchases. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items wrongfully. In this report, I will be discussing Credit Card Fraud Detection as a binary classifi cation task and use various machine learning models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.

## Features
- **Data preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Model training**: Trains multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Fraud prediction**: Predicts whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not based on the trained model.

## Usage
- To run the fraud detection model:

```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

- The script will preprocess the dataset, train the model, and output the evaluation results.

## Results
The model's performance will be displayed after training, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Report
The full project report, which includes detailed analysis, results, and conclusions, can be found in the _Final Report.pdf_.
